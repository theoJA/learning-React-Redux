# Blog

A simple blog app that allows the user to create a new post with title, category, and content. The created posts will be shown on the index page by title. These posts are clicable and will display the contents of a post when clicked. The blog app allows users to navigate through the various pages of the app.

This app was part of an online React course I am currently taking on Udemy. As my familiarity with React grows, I may or may not be adding my own extra functionalities to it.

### To run: 
- Clone repo and cd to project directory
- npm install
- npm run start
- 'localhost:8081' on the browser
