# Weather-Map app

A weather app that allows the user to search for a city and returns a map of the city (only works with US cities for now) and a 40-day weather forecast for the city.   

This app was part of an online React course I am currently taking on Udemy. As my familiarity with React grows, I may or may not be adding my own extra functionalities to it.

### To run: 
- Clone repo and cd to project directory
- npm install
- npm run start
- 'localhost:8080' on the browser
