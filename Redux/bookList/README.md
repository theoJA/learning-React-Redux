# Book list

A simple web app that displays a list of book titles. The titles are clickable and when clicked, displays the number of pages (anything can be displayed really). This app gives a simple introduction to Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. In this particular app, two of the most important concepts of Redux, reducers and action creators, were used to store and manipulate data in our app. 

This app was part of an online React course I am currently taking on Udemy. As my familiarity with React grows, I may or may not be adding my own extra functionalities to it.
